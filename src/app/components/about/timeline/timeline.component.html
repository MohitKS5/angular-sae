      <h2>Formula Bharat '16</h2>
      <p align="justify">We competed in FS India for the first time in 2016 and this was our second
        participation in FS events. Weight reduction, manufacturability and reliability were the key
        design goals. Ergonomics and compact packaging were the major areas of improvement this year.

      <h2>Baja Student '16</h2>
      <p>This was our second off road vehicle which was built to compete in the competition BSI 2016. The
        design objectives were to build a robust, light weight and efficient vehicle that could endure
        the brutality of off road tracks. We designed and fabricated our gear box which was the central
        jewel in our masterpiece. It weighed 68% less than that used in the previous season. Our car had
        a compact packaging of all the components which ultimately ensured lower center of gravity,
        weight reduction and thus better maneuverability and performance. The final weight of the car
        was 161 kilograms which was a reduction of 20% from the previous car. Viva La #92!</p>

      <h2>Baja Student '15</h2>
      <p>Our first off-road vehicle which was agile and lightweight. Design objective was to build light
        weight car that could perform in harsh conditions. Since it was our first car our, one of our
        objectives was to successfully complete all the dynamic events without major component failure
        and yet delivering the maximum performance. The vehicle dynamics associated with the car were
        highly tunable which gave us the freedom to juice the best out of our car. Will always be loved

      <h2>Formula Student '15</h2>
      <p>We started our first season of Formula SAE with emphasis being laid on designing a car which is
        simple yet efficient. Drivability, reliability and cost effectiveness were the specific areas
        focused upon.Emphasis was laid on maximizing the learning curve and working things out from the
        very basic principles. Various tests were performed for different subsystems of the car so as to
        enhance the final performance. Documentation of the whole design process was also done to make
        sure all the data was available for any future reference. Thus, a data driven design process
        focused on the basic principles of designing resulted in the building of an efficacious car. The
        grand ancestor of all #091!</p>

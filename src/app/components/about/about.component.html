      <h2>About Us{{json}}</h2>
      <p align="justify">SAE IIT Kanpur is a student run organization at one of the premier technical institutes
        of the country, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. We are a team of highly motivated, enthusiastic,
        passionate and dedicated students who work towards the ultimate goal of building a ‘Racecar’. Our team
        comprises of students from a spectrum of different departments and years (i.e. First years to Post
        Graduates) who are passionate to pursue, explore, learn and gain experience in automotive. </p>
      <p style="margin-top:10px;" align="justify">We began our venture in the year 2011, by the collective efforts
        of a group of students with a strong urge to complement the theoretical knowledge imparted in
        classrooms, emphasizing on the practical aspects of engineering. Their idea to develop an automotive
        culture revolutionized the institute and SAE IIT Kanpur started with an initial strength of over 150
        student members.The competitions we participate in are highly prestigious and are judged by the
        professionals who command respect in the automotive industry in order to showcase our technical prowess,
        skills and hone our knowledge pertaining to real life engineering.</p>
      <p style="margin-top:10px;" align="justify">By becoming a part of SAE IIT Kanpur, students embark upon the
        path that will nurture priceless practical skills in their respective fields of both engineering and
        business, enriching their college experience and equipping them with the knowledge that will allow them
        to prosper in their chosen career.</p>

      <h2>SAE International</h2>
      <p>SAE International, founded in 1905, is a global association of more than 1,38,000 engineers and related
        technical experts dedicated to advancing mobility technology for use in everyday life. SAE India is an
        affiliate society of SAE International registered in India as a national non-profit engineering and
        scientific society dedicated to advancement of mobile industry in India.</p>

      <h2>Formula SAE</h2>
      <p>Formula SAE is an international student design competition sponsored by the Society of Automotive
        Engineers. The program simulates real-world engineering design projects and related challenges with the
        goal of developing and building a small Formula-style race car. Teams from countries around the world
        compete in static and dynamic events. </p>
      <p style="margin-top:10px;">The concept behind Formula SAE is that a fictional manufacturing company has
        contracted a student design team to develop a small Formula-Style Race Car. The Prototype Race Car is to
        be evaluated for its potential as a production item. The target marketing group for the race car is the
        non-professional weekend autocross racer. Each student team designs, builds and tests a prototype based
        on a series of rules, whose purpose is both ensuring on-track safety (the cars are driven by the
        students themselves) and promoting clever problem solving.</p>
      <h3>FSAE Rules & Regulations</h3>
      <p>Teams taking part in Formula SAE are judged in a series of static and dynamic events. Static events
        include things like business presentation engineering design and cost and sustainability.The teams who
        pass the static events are then allowed to participate in the dynamic events where they are scored based
        on how well their vehicle performs in various tasks. Therefore, Formula SAE encompasses all aspects of a
        business including research, design, manufacturing, testing, developing, marketing, management, and fund
        raising.</p>

      <p style="margin-top:10px;">The volunteers for the design judging include some the racing industry's most
        prominent engineers and consultants including the late Carroll Smith, Bill Mitchell, Doug Milliken,
        Claude Rouelle, Jack Auld, John LePlante, Ron Tauranac, and Bryan Kubala.</p>

      <h2>BAJA SAE</h2>
      <p>Baja SAE is another design competition held under the banner of SAE International. It encourages teams of
        students from universities all over the world to design and build small off-road vehicles adhering
        strictly to rules. The vehicle must be safe, easily transported, easily maintained and fun to drive.It
        should be able to traverse rough terrain without damage. It is held in US, India, Brazil, South Africa
        and Korea. In India, the event is organized by SAE India.</p>

      <h2>Effi-Cycle</h2>
      <p>Efficycle is an intercollegiate design competition for undergraduate and graduate students where teams
        have to design and fabricate an energy efficient entirely human powered three-wheeled vehicle. The
        vehicle must be aerodynamic, highly engineeredand ergonomically designed. The design should be
        commercially viable as a product andshould be attractive to the consumers because of its visual
        appearance, performance,reliability and ease of operation.
      </p><br>
      <p>The Competition includes designing, validating and fabricating a three wheeled vehicle driven by two
        drivers. The vehicle would be capable to be driven simultaneously as well as alternatively by two
        drivers. The vehicle would be evaluated for its design and performance and the teams compete against
        each other. The cumulative scores of all the events would decide the overall ranking of the teams in the
        event. </p>

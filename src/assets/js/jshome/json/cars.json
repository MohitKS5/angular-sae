The car which was developed over little more than a year was lighter, faster and nippier than the 2008 Vayu. The highlights of Agni our entry to Formula Student 2009 was the 22% weight reduction, the integrated seat and firewall, engine producing 10% more horses, an all new 50% lighter drive train and 4 way adjustable shock absorbers. At the competition we would compete against the best of the universities in Europe and also the 5 other teams from India.IIT Bombay Racing team was hosted in UK by Aston University in Birmingham. The team truly felt at home at the Aston University, with the interaction not only limited to their Formula Student team but also socially with team events and a launch.",
